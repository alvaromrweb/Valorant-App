# Valorant GG EZ
Valorant App to display account info and history made with React and TailwindCSS for learning purposes

TODOS:
- Add header with search input
- Make a router so you can access a player profile by a url instead of having to search always
- Add dropdown match details with the rest of players in the match
- Store recent searches in localstorage and show them when focusing the search input
- Make infinite scroll load of matches
- Store data fetch in database, and only fetch when the data is not in the database or needs refresh
